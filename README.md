## 1. Project Overview

River Song AI is a sophisticated **home-based artificial intelligence assistant** designed to seamlessly integrate with your living environment. Its core functionalities revolve around activity recognition, smart device control, contextual awareness, and personalized user experiences. The project is structured with a powerful Python-based AI backend and multi-platform frontend applications, starting with Android.

It aims to provide intelligent automation and insights into daily life, making smart homes more intuitive and responsive to user needs.

## 2. Architecture

River Song AI employs a **client-server architecture**:

* **Python Backend (River Song AI Core)**: This is the brain of the system, written in Python. It houses various AI/ML models for perception (speech, vision, context), decision-making (automation, recommendations), and integration with external services (smart home platforms, data feeds). It exposes its functionalities via a robust API.
* **Android Application (Frontend)**: This is the first client-facing interface, built with Kotlin. It communicates with the Python backend via HTTP requests (APIs) to provide a user-friendly interface for device control, monitoring, and personalized interactions.

This separation allows for independent scaling and development of the backend AI and the various client applications.

## 3. Key Features

### Python Backend Capabilities:

* **Perception & Input Processing:**
    * **Speech Recognition & Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Voice commands, conversation management, intent classification, sentiment analysis.
    * **Image & Video Analysis:** Facial recognition, gesture control, object detection, activity recognition, scene understanding.
    * **Environmental Sensing:** Integration with temperature, humidity, light, motion sensors.
    * **Contextual Awareness:** Activity tracking, presence detection, time-based context.
    * **Data Feeds:** Integration with external APIs (Weather, News, Sports, Stock Market, Social Media).
* **Intelligence & Automation:**
    * **AI/ML Model Training & Fine-tuning:** Capabilities to train and adapt AI models.
    * **Smart Home Integration:** Appliance control, lighting, smart locks, thermostats, camera feeds.
    * **Automation:** Task prioritization, workflow automation.
    * **Recommendation & Personalization:** AI-driven recommendations based on user behavior and preferences.
    * **Security:** Intrusion detection.
* **Core System Services:**
    * **Centralized Controller:** Orchestrates all modules and data flow.
    * **Communication Manager:** Handles inter-process communication and networking.
    * **Error Handling:** Robust error logging and AI-powered analysis.
    * **Resource Management:** Efficient handling of files and configurations.
    * **Scheduler:** Manages and executes timed tasks.
    * **Security Manager:** Ensures system security with encryption, hashing, and anomaly detection.
    * **User Management:** Supports various user roles (Admin, Parent, Child, Guest) with granular permissions.

### Android Application Features:

* **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration.
* **Personalized Dashboard:** Displays user-specific information and summaries.
* **Smart Home Control:** Intuitive interface to view and control connected devices (lights, thermostats, locks).
* **Real-time Data Display:** Shows current status of devices and sensors.
* **Modular & Extensible UI:** Built with Fragments and ViewModels for maintainability.
* **Dependency Injection:** Uses Koin for a scalable and testable architecture.
* **API Integration:** Seamless communication with the Python backend via Retrofit.

## 4. Getting Started - Python Backend

To get the River Song AI Python backend up and running:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/RiverSongAI.git](https://github.com/your-username/RiverSongAI.git) # Replace with your actual repository URL
    cd RiverSongAI
    ```
2.  **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys and sensitive configurations as specified in `config/config.py` and documentation (e.g., `KILL_SWITCH_PASSWORD_HASH`, external API keys).
5.  **Run the Main Controller:**
    ```bash
    python -m controllers.controller_module.controller_module
    ```
    (Refer to specific backend module documentation for running individual components or API server setup).

## 5. Getting Started - Android Application

To set up and run the River Song Android application:

1.  **Open in Android Studio:**
    * Launch Android Studio.
    * Select `File > Open`, then navigate to and select the `riversong_android_app` directory. Android Studio will recognize it as a Gradle project.
2.  **Gradle Sync:**
    * Android Studio will automatically start syncing Gradle. Ensure your internet connection is active so it can download all necessary dependencies (as defined in `app/build.gradle.kts` and root `build.gradle.kts`). Resolve any sync errors.
3.  **Update Backend URL:**
    * In `app/src/main/java/com/riversongai/App.kt` and `app/src/main/java/com/riversongai/di/AppModule.kt`, update the `BASE_URL` constant (or variable) to point to the actual IP address or domain name of your running Python backend API.
        * Example: `"http://192.168.1.XXX:5000/"` (replace XXX with your backend server's local IP).
4.  **Run on Emulator or Device:**
    * Select an Android Emulator or connect a physical Android device.
    * Click the "Run" button (green triangle) in Android Studio. The app should build and launch on your selected device/emulator.

## 6. Project Structure

This project is divided into two main parts:

* **`RiverSongAI/`**: The core Python backend.
* **`riversong_android_app/`**: The Android frontend.
